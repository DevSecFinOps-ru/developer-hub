This topic provides an overview of triggers in Harness. Harness uses triggers as a core component to automate and streamline deployment workflows. Triggers help you automate the execution of your pipelines based on some event like a new artifact/manifest, or run on a schedule or an external webhook. Triggers offer a versatile and dynamic approach to initiating processes based on specific events, changes, or conditions in pipelines.
